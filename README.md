# Facial-expression-recognition-using-keras
A guided project in collaboration with coursera. We have used the Emotion FER dataset in this corsework/project. 
Automatic facial expression analysis is an interesting and challenging problem, and impacts important applications in many areas such as humanâ€“computer interaction and data-driven animation.
The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. 
The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.
The training set consists of 28,709 examples. 
The public test set used for the leaderboard consists of 3,589 examples. 
The final test set, which was used to determine the winner of the competition, consists of another 3,589 examples.
This dataset was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part of an ongoing research project. They have graciously provided the workshop organizers with a preliminary version of their dataset to use for this contest.
